# DDreshape
DDreshape is program written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) for reshaping existing [Dungeondraft](https://dungeondraft.net/) maps. Dungeondraft is a map making tool for fantasy role-playing games. As of writing this, Dungeondraft is still in beta, and as such, [include bugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondraft/comments/f9wh5y/known_bugs_report_a_bug/) and some planned functionality is missing.
Reshaping (such as resizing or cropping) the map, after it has been created, is an [expected and anticipated funtionality](https://www.reddit.com/r/dungeondraft/comments/fcpn0a/is_there_any_method_for_resizing_a_map/), but it has not yet been inplemented in Dungeodraft.

The purpose of DDreshape is to fill the gap between current beta release of Dungeondraft and the final release, where reshaping is implemented in Dungeondraft.

DDreshape lets you pad, crop, rotate and flip your existing Dungeondraft maps.
